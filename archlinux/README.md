# Cheat sheet to install and configure Archlinux

This is personal notes to install and configure **Archlinux** (or any other
distro based on it) so do not expect it fit into everyone.

- [install](./install.md): install Archlinux dual boot with current Windows
- [initialization](./initialization.md): install vanila desktop environment
